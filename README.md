- **Personalization:** Smart calorie goals that adapt based on user progress.  
- **Inclusivity:** A diverse food database that includes home-cooked meals and global cuisines.  
- **Motivation:** Streaks, reminders, and progress badges to encourage long-term use.  
- **AI Assistance:** Use image recognition to estimate calories from a **photo of your meal**.
